# add_library() wrapper that adds a second variant of the library for use in the
# exported Kudu C++ client. This variant is suffixed with "_exported" and is
# compiled with special visibility flags to hide all symbols except those that
# are part of the public ABI.
#
# There are two different kinds of exported libraries: internal and leaf.
# Internal libraries are static archives while leaf libraries are shared
# objects built from internal libraries. In practice there is only one leaf
# library: the Kudu C++ client itself.
#
# Arguments:
#
# LIB_NAME is the name of the library. It must come first. Required.
#
# SRCS is the list of source files to compile into the library. Required.
#
# DEPS is the list of targets that both library variants depend on. Required.
#
# NONLINK_DEPS is the list of (non-linked) targets that both library variants
# depend on. Optional.
#
# COMPILE_FLAGS is a string containing any additional compilation flags that
# should be added to both library variants. Optional.
#
# EXPORTED_SHARED is a toggle that, if set, indicates that the exported variant
# is a "leaf" library. Otherwise it is an "internal" library. Optional.
#
# EXPORTED_OUTPUT_NAME is a string describing a different file name for the
# exported library variant. If not set, defaults to LIB_NAME. Optional.
#
# EXPORTED_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY is a string describing a different directory where
# the exported library variant should be written. If not set, defaults to the
# directory where this function was called. Optional.
#
# EXPORTED_DEPS is a list of targets that the exported library variant depends
# on. If not set, defaults to DEPS. Optional.
